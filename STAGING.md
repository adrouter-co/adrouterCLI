# Staging validation artifacts

Only `.github/workflows/ci.yml` is approved for this source migration. It uses read-only
repository permissions and no hosted credentials. Release, deployment and promotion workflows
remain disabled. Published versions and release manifests are unchanged.

Successful CI jobs retain their tested package, native ZIP or archived build for seven days.
Artifact names include the workflow source SHA and platform/job. `staging-manifest.json`
records the exact checkout SHA, run/attempt and each file's SHA-256; `SHA256SUMS` also covers
the manifest. Verify both after download. A successful individual artifact does not make the
surface green: every required matrix job must pass on the same source SHA.

`ADROUTER_STAGING_OUTPUT` optionally retains the successfully tested tarball before the package
check removes its temporary directory. It does not repack or publish the package.

`STAGING_VERIFIED — live acceptance pending owner testing` requires all required CI jobs and
artifact/source/checksum verification. It does not assert deployment or live acceptance.
